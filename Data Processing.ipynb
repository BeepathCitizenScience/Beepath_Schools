    "### We process and clean the original data in order to prepare them for the study. The original data is composed by 161,009 GPS locations corresponding to 262 users from the 10 schools. However, a great number of participants used a different transport method for the study rather than walking. Furthermore, there are several trajectories that were not correctly recorded (with just few GPS locations and no clear path). Finally, we also need to clean each individual path from outliers, that mainly appear and the beginning and the end of the trajectory due to the GPS connection. \n",
