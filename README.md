3. The dolfer "processed and interpolated data" contains the processed and cleaned data as in the case above but with the data interpolated in order to have all GPS locations uniformly separated by one second.

4. The folder "Results. txt files" contains several .txt files with the results for the Mean Squared Displacement and the Autocorrelation for several cases (interpolated data, no interpolated data, confidence intervals, etc).
